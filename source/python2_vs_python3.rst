Python versions 2.x vs 3.x
**************************

This page is about python versions and little about differeneces.

Most popular python versions are 2.7 and 3.6. Unfortunately python2.x and 3.x versions are partialy uncompatible with each other and all newly developed functionalities, improvements are only available in python 3.x

If you need to use python 2.x for the most compatibility between scrips writen in python3.x it's strongly recomended to use python2.7

Some external python modules are going to stop support of python2.x for example Django (popular python web framework) in his older version 1.11 will stop supporting python2.x in 2020.

So, to smooth start with python learning, let's use the only 3.x version (exacly the newest one 3.7).
