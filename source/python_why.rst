     Python is designed to allow developers to create code easy to use, write, read, reuse and maintain.
  
  * Portability

     Code written in Python is portable it means there is no need to make any conversion between platforms, to use code working for linux on a windows just copy and paste it. Most of GUI, database, web frameworks for Python allows to create portable code as well.

  * External libraries

     There are a lot Python libraries available to download, which makes Python unversal language most popular libraries are:
   
    * Django - web framework
    * Scrapy - web scrapping

    * SQLAlchemy - databases
    * BeautifulSoup - xml/html paring
    * matplotlib - numerlical plotting

  Ways to get those libraries will be introduced later

  Bigest disadventage of Python is program speed, in comparison to other langugaes like C++/Java Python can take much more time to do things but save developement time.
